## Code Quality Checks

After completing code changes, always run the following checks before finishing your response:

1. **Format Check** - Verify code formatting is correct:
   ```bash
   npm run format:check
   ```

2. **Lint Check** - Check for linting errors:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

3. **Unit Tests** - Run all unit tests:
   ```bash
   npm test -- --run
   ```

If any check fails:
- For format issues: Run `npm run format` to fix formatting, then verify with `format:check`
- For lint issues: Fix the linting errors in the code
- For test failures: Fix the failing tests or update tests if the behavior change was intentional

Only consider the task complete when all three checks pass successfully.
